# Toggle Persona Memory
## Description
This mod for Persona 3 FES adds the ability to toggle the Persona Memory feature on or off, allowing you to choose whether the game remembers your last selected persona in battle, similar to later entries in the Persona series. 

## Future plans
Right now the patch only turns off this feature since the game already has it activated. In the future, a toggle will be added so it can be changed at will.

## Compilation
This mod is written in a custom language for PS2 cheats called CLPS2C, so the first step to compile this mod is to use the [CLPS2C-Compiler](https://github.com/NiV-L-A/CLPS2C-Compiler/tree/master).

However, in the current version of the compiler (1.0.1 at the time of writing), a bug causes the mod to compile incorrectly, resulting in a game crash during testing. To avoid this, you will need to use [alexankitty's](https://github.com/alexankitty) keystone pull request, which can be found [here](https://github.com/alexankitty/keystone). This ensures that the cheat compiles and runs correctly in the game.
